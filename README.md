## Build the Image using Dockerfile

1. Navigate to your project directory where the Dockerfile is located.

   $ cd chitikka-node-service

2. Run the following command to build the Docker image. Replace `chitikka-node-app` with your desired image name.

   ```bash

3. Now that we've created the Docker image, let's run our image on port `8000` 

   ```bash
   $ docker run --name chitikka-api -d -p 8000:8000 chitikka-node-app
   ```
   Where `chitikka-api` is the container name and `chitikka-node-app` is the docker image

4. You can verify that the container is running by checking the list of running containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker ps

5. Stop/Start the Instance
